Our code is run on Kongull which is a linux cluster using CentOS 5.3 and running Rocks. The cluster has 1 login node, 4 I/O nodes and 108 compute nodes. 96 of the compute nodes have two 6-core AMD Istanbul processors while the 12 last nodes have 2 8-core Intel Sandy Bridge processors. For more information about the cluster we refer to the clusters webpage \cite{kongull}.

We used these modules on kongull:
\begin{itemize}
\item cmake
\item intelcomp
\item openmpi/1.4.3-intel.
\end{itemize}
We also made sure to compile with the standard C and fortran flags, as well as the needed flags for openMP and MPI. The optimization flags have been set to maximum (-O3).
