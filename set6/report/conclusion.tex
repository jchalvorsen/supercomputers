We have been able to implement a parallel poisson solver using both OpenMP, MPI and a hybrid model, and verified its correctness. Using the cluster Kongull, runtime, speedup and efficiency tests were performed. The results of these tests show that the parallel code is faster than the serial implementation. Also, for our implementation, the pure distributed model outclasses the hybrid model when we limit the use of nodes. We suspect this is because alot of OpenMP calls has to be made compared to the two times data has to be sent using MPI calls. When we are liberal in the use of nodes the hybrid model seems to holding it's own ground. The best timing result we got was just above 25 seconds for the problem with $N=16384$ nodes in each spatial direction spread across 18 nodes, with $p=1$ and $t=2$ on each node for a total of 36 processors/threads. We could not get access to 36 nodes to test with $p=1$ and $t=1$.
