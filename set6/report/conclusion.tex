We have been able to implement a parallel poisson solver using both OpenMP, MPI and a hybrid model, and verified its correctness. Using the cluster Kongull, runtime, speedup and efficiency tests were performed. The results of these tests show that the parallel code is faster than the serial implementation. Also, for our implementation, the pure distributed model outclasses the hybrid model. We suspect this is because alot of OpenMP calls has to be made compared to the two times data has to be sent using MPI calls.
